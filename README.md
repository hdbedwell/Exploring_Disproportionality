# Exploring_Disproportionality
I begin the analysis by comparing percents of suspensions to percents of enrollment by racial group and students with disabilities (SWD). I then use visualizations to emphasize the disproportionality betwwen some groups based on the percent of enrollment and percent of suspensions. 

From there, I move on to looking at relative risk and visualizing the risk of various groups being suspended as compared to their peers.
